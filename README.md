# CodEXpander

## Program Usage
This tool expands header definitions in source and haeder ```#include``` macro statements.
It reads a specified file or directory with files and creates a summarized file to view the current order of definitons of classes, functions, types and more.

## Background
When programming in C/C++ the way how you make functions, classed and more available for other source and header files, is via including header files with their definitions. The implementation of those are usually made in designated source files. When working with header files ```#include``` statements this file to be included could also contain a ```#include``` statements, which can create many layers of copying the content of those specified header files. When a error occours regarding a definition, it can get really difficult to find the exact error casue in one of those displayed files from the compiler program. In order to make the way how C\C++ extracts code segments easier, this tool should give you a better overview where definitions are not at the right places in the found files.
